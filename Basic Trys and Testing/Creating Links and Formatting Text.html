  <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. <br> Many <em>students</em>  define <strong>paragraphs</strong>  in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five <strong>sentences</strong>, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. <br> In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p>
